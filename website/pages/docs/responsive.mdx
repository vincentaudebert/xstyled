# Responsive

Handling responsive is very easy with `@xstyled/system` either using props or utilities.

## Tweak a component for responsive

Using [style props](/docs/style-props/), you can tweak a component right from props. Each one of them accepts an object to define responsive values for each prop.

```js
import { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

/* The box will be displayed only in mobile! */
const OnlyMobileBox = () => <Box display={{ sm: 'block', md: 'none' }} />
```

See [style using props](/docs/style-using-props/) to know how to use system props in your components.

## Grid system

Grid system are [bootstrap like](https://getbootstrap.com/) grids. It gives you powerful responsive grids using flexboxes.

```js
// A row containing three cols (same size)
<Box row>
  <Box col />
  <Box col />
  <Box col />
</Box>

// By default, cols measure 100%, start from "md" breakpoint: they measure "1/3" of the size
<Box row>
  <Box col={{ xs: 1, md: 1 / 3 }} />
  <Box col={{ xs: 1, md: 1 / 3 }} />
  <Box col={{ xs: 1, md: 1 / 3 }} />
</Box>

// First col use the size of content, others share the space
<Box row>
  <Box col="auto" />
  <Box col />
  <Box col />
</Box>

// Apply a gutter of 2 on each cols, remove gutter on the ends
<Box row mx={-2}>
  <Box col px={2} />
  <Box col px={2} />
  <Box col px={2} />
</Box>
```

See a [complete guide about Grid system](/docs/grid-system/).

## Create a responsive component

`breakpoints` is a utility to create mobile first responsive components.

```js
import { breakpoints } from '@xstyled/system'

const Container = styled.div(
  breakpoints({
    xs: css`
      /* All devices */
    `,
    md: css`
      /* From md breakpoint */
    `,
    lg: css`
      /* From lg breakpoint */
    `,
  }),
)
```

Default good breakpoints are available. They can also be specified under the key `breakpoints` in your theme:

You can also use `up`, `down` and `between`:

```js
import styled, { css, up, down } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

const Box = styled.div`
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;

  /* This style applies only after "md" breakpoint */
  ${up(
    'md',
    css`
      height: 300px;
    `,
  )}

  /* This style applies only before "md" breakpoint */
  ${down(
    'md',
    css`
      height: 100px;
    `,
  )}
`
```

See [all system utilities available](/docs/system-utilities/).

## Default breakpoints

```js
// theme.js
export default {
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 576,
    md: 768,
    lg: 992,
    xl: 1200,
  },
}
```

The above breakpoints are the default values provided by xstyled.
