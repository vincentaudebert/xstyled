# Prop Types

`@xstyled/prop-types` exposes a utility to generate prop-types from a system prop utility.

## How to get Prop Types?

Import `getSystemPropTypes` from `@xstyled/prop-types` and generates prop-types for a custom utility.

```js
import { compose, space, color } from '@xstyled/system'
import { getSystemPropTypes } from '@xstyled/prop-types'

const customSystem = compose(space, color)

const SystemBox = styled.div`
  ${customSystem}
`

SystemBox.propTypes = getSystemPropTypes(customSystem)
```
